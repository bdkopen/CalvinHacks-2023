This project uses the Arduino IDE for writing and compiling. To connect with the BlackPill, the [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html#overview) was used.
* Configuration settings to connect with the BlackPill came from [this tutorial](https://www.sgbotic.com/index.php?dispatch=pages.view&page_id=49)
* The board configuration URL in the previous tutorial is depreciated. This url was used instead:
